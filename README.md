# Measurement Noise Mitigation in a Quantum Computer Using Image Intensity Filters

## Abstract
We propose a method to mitigate measurement errors in the distribution counts of a Quantum computer using image contrast filters. This work is similar to the method described by Gambetta and colleagues in [1]; however our technique does not use a linear system of equations, but an image contrast filter to mitigate the measurement noise. Furthermore this method is demonstrated against the same set of experiments described in the matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) library from Qiskit from which [1] is based upon. Our results show our method outperforming M3 by a wide margin in all experiments. Finally, we provide results, documentation and detailed test and source code for further investigation.
